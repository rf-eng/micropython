class I2S -- a serial protocol for connecting digital audio devices
=======================================

I2S (Inter-IC Sound), is an electrical serial bus interface standard used for connecting digital audio devices together. 
It is used to communicate PCM audio data between integrated circuits in an electronic device

I2S objects are created attached to a specific bus.  They can be initialised
when created, or initialised later on.

Printing the I2S object gives you information about its configuration.
